** In Table Per Concret Class Inheritance Mapping one table is created per concret Class. **

*********************************************************************************************
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
=>This line indicate to Table Per Concret Class Inheritance Mapping.And this line write upside to Parent table.

@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) 
=> Above line don't write in your Parent Class Because In Test Class We explicitly set Id of Parent class 
By the use of Every Class reference.
**********************************************************************************************
@AttributeOverrides(@AttributeOverride(name = "vehicleName", column = @Column(name = "VEHICLE_NAME")) )
=>This line is part of child class. This line is optional line.If you not write above line of code in your
child class so in database one more table is created by hibernate to maintain Inheritance maping.
If We write this line so in that case no any extra table is created in database automatically.Basically 
By this line we override Parent table Columns in child table.
